= Introduction =
This document will show you the basic of building a custom version of WinFF for your product. For example if you wish to create a version of winff with just your presets or for a custom version of ffmpeg

= Getting Started =

The First thing you will need is the WIN32Setup folder from svn. I use [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ Tortoise svn], but you can use what ever you like.

The next thing you will need is Jordan Russell's [http://www.innosetup.com/isinfo.php Inno Setup]

Once you have Innosetup installed you need to get the following language files for it on the [http://www.innosetup.com/files/istrans/ unofficial language page]:
 * Bulgarian
 * Turkish
 * Chinese Traditional

Then put the language files in "C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 5\Languages" with the following names:
 * Bulgarian.isl
 * Turkish.isl
 * Chinesetrad.isl
