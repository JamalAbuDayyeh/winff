= Introduction =

Until the packages are completely accepted (and after that for faster updates) Ubuntu packages are available at [http://winff.org/] and at my [https://launchpad.net/~paul-climbing/+archive Personal Package Archive (PPA)] provided by [http://launchpad.net Launchpad].

Also a fuller featured ffmpeg is available via [http://www.medibuntu.org/ Medibuntu] for Hardy users.

= Details Winff =

The Ubuntu repositories come in two flavors. We provide our *signed* repository at [http://winff.org] or you can use the *unsigned* repository at [https://launchpad.net/~paul-climbing/+archive Launchpad]. We have not received any complains about our prive repo, so that is recommended, but for redundancy we mention Launchpad as well.

I describe to procedures, one using the command line, the other using synaptic. First the command line.

== Command line ==
If you use the signed repository you need to accept the key [http://winff.org/ubuntu/AAFE086A.gpg AAFE086A]. To get that installed you can run:

{{{
wget --quiet --output-document=- "http://winff.org/ubuntu/AAFE086A.gpg" | sudo apt-key add -
}}}

After that you need to add the repository to apt. You can do that by entering the line (1) in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winff.list. You will have to create that file, which can be done with the following command:
{{{
echo "deb http://winff.org/ubuntu intrepid universe" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winff.list
}}}
Of course you need to change intrepid to hardy or jaunty if you have that. (You can also just add the line to /etc/apt/sources.list .)

You can now install WinFF directly by running:
{{{
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install winff
}}}

interpid users also want to run:
{{{
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-unstripped-51 
}}}

jaunty users also want to run:
{{{
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-unstripped-52 
}}}
----
*If you are having problems* with the described procedure, please file a bug in our [http://code.google.com/p/winff/issues/list bug tracker]. Please include in the bug the output of 
{{{
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winff.list
# and
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install winff
}}}
----

(1) `deb http://winff.org/ubuntu intrepid universe`
_(or if you prefer the PPA:)_ 
`deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/paul-climbing/ubuntu intrepid main`
(replace intrepid with your release)  Unfortunately the packages in the PPA are unsigned at the moment so you will have to accept the warning given by your package manager if you use those.

== Synaptic ==

If you are using synaptic to install packages you have to download and save the [http://winff.org/ubuntu/AAFE086A.gpg key (right click here)]. Then go in the synaptic menu to Setting -> Repositories.

Now go to the tab "Authentication", press "Import Key File" and select the just downloaded [http://winff.org/ubuntu/AAFE086A.gpg file].

Now go to the "Third-party Software" tab and select "add"

In the next field type (or copy/paste) `deb http://winff.org/ubuntu intrepid universe` (change intrepid to *your* release) and press "Add source".

Now, after you press "Reload" you can just choose winff from the list. If you have winff installed from Matt's package file, you should uninstall that first.

= Warning non standard ffmpeg =
If you don't run the standard Ubuntu ffmpeg and want to make use of the more extended original set of presets, please read the README.Debian (3) after installation. If you find that your presets don't work, try the other presets files that are available [http://code.google.com/p/winff/downloads/list here].

In order to use an other presets file than supplied with the package you might need to remove the old preset file in ~/.winff/presets.xml , but by doing that you will also remove self-made presets. So if you made or edited the presets, you want to compare the files manually.

= Details ffmpeg for Interpid (Jaunty) =

Intrepid contains a pretty complete ffmpeg already, but you probably want to have ubuntu-restricted-extras installed which should pull in the 'unstripped' versions of several libraries. You can also look for them directly: libavcodec-unstripped-51, libavutil-unstripped-49 and libavformat-unstripped-52 from the multiverse repository.

= Details ffmpeg for Hardy =

Because of legal and copyright issues not all codec are standard available in ffmpeg from Ubuntu. If you don't mind these issues (see the [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu Medibuntu wiki]) you can install the fuller featured ffmpeg from [http://www.medibuntu.org/ Medibuntu]. The full explanation is available at [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu]. In short the procedure is as follows:

  * add the medibuntu repository to your sources, for instance using the following command:
  {{{
  sudo wget http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/hardy.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list
  }}}
  If you are running Gutsy or... replace the string "hardy" by that version of ubuntu.

  * After that you should add the GPG Key via:
  {{{
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get update
  }}}
  You may be asked to accept this package even though it cannot be authenticated. This is normal; typing "Yes" means you trust Medibuntu. If you want to import the gpg key of medibuntu directly, it has number: 0C5A2783 The contains you can find for instance at [http://wwwkeys.pgp.net:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EBC26B60C5A2783 pgp.net].

Now you are ready to install the medibuntu version of ffmpeg.

Beware, because the medibuntu version of ffmpeg is usually newer, the presets that come with winff might not always work. Please take a look at the [http://www.biggmatt.com/forums/index.php?board=3.0 forum].
