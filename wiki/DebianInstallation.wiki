= Introduction =

Until the packages are completely accepted (and after that for faster updates) Debian packages build for Ubuntu are available at my [https://launchpad.net/~paul-climbing/+archive Personal Package Archive (PPA)] provided by [http://launchpad.net Launchpad].

Also a fuller featured ffmpeg is available via [http://www.debian-multimedia.org/].

= Details Winff =

If you are running Debian you can easily install WinFF by entering the line (1) (stable) or (2) (testing or unstable) in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winff.list. You will have to create that file, or just add the line to /etc/apt/sources.list .

After you update using your favorite package manager (3)(4) and you can just choose winff from the list. If you have winff installed from Matt's package file, you might need to uninstall that first. Unfortunately the packages are unsigned at the moment so you will have to accept the warning given by your package manager.

If you don't run the standard Ubuntu ffmpeg and want to make use of the more extended original set of presets, please read the README.Debian (5) after installation.

In order to use the preset file supplied with the package you might need to remove the old preset file in ~/.winff/presets.xml , but by doing that you will also remove self-made presets. So if you made or edited the presets, you want to compare the files manually. 

(1) deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/paul-climbing/ubuntu hardy main

(2) deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/paul-climbing/ubuntu intrepid main

(3) for instance "apt-get update" or

(4) in synaptic pressing "update"

(5) /usr/share/doc/winff/README.Debian

= Details ffmpeg =

Because of legal and copyright issues not all codec are standard available in ffmpeg from Debian. If you don't mind these issues you can install the fuller featured ffmpeg from [http://debian-multimedia.org/]. The full explanation is available at [http://debian-multimedia.org/]. In short the procedure is as follows:

  * Add the GPG Key under root via:
  {{{
  wget http://debian-multimedia.org/gpgkey.pub -O - | apt-key add - && apt-get install debian-multimedia-keyring
  }}}

  * Then add the debian-multimedia repository to your sources, either in /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-multimedia:
  {{{
  deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org etch main
  }}}
  or
  {{{
  deb ftp://ftp.debian-multimedia.org etch main
  }}}
  or
  {{{
  deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org stable main
  }}}
  or
  {{{
  deb ftp://ftp.debian-multimedia.org stable main  
  }}}

Now you are ready to install the debian-multimedia version of ffmpeg.

Beware, because the debian-multimedia version of ffmpeg is usually newer, the presets that come with winff might not always work. Please take a look at the [http://www.biggmatt.com/forums/index.php?board=3.0 forum].
